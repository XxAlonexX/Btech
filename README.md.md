# Welcome to XxAlonexX’s B-Tech Notes Repository! 🎉📚

Yo! You’ve just entered the world of **My B-Tech notes**. Here, you’ll find all my precious notes, figures, and codes throughout my B-Tech journey! You’re probably here to _steal some wisdom_ (we all do it 😉), so let me break it down for you:

## Repo Structure 🔥

Each subject folder will have:

- **Notes**: Where I dump all my hard-earned knowledge (and sometimes, last-minute cramming 😜).
- **Figures**: Because diagrams > paragraphs, am I right? 🤷‍♂️
- **Codes**: For when the theory isn’t enough and you need to **run that beast** 🖥️💻.

## What’s Inside? 🤔

Each subject has its own folder, filled with the usual suspects:

- Notes (did I mention this already? 😅)
- Diagrams that somehow make everything clear
- Code snippets that actually work (hopefully!)

## Why should you care? 🤨

1. **Learn with me**: These notes are not just mine, they’re for everyone. Learning together, making things easier, one subject at a time.
2. **Tidy structure**: Can you imagine finding notes easily without scrolling for days? Yeah, that’s a thing now.
3. **Funny as heck**: Okay, maybe not that funny, but it’s worth a shot!

## Contribution? 🤩

Wanna make it better? Got some suggestions? Fork it, add your own notes, or just hit me up for some _notes-sharing therapy_. 🙌

Now, go ahead and browse the awesomeness I’ve put together for you! 😎
